- **CLI:** User-friendly and straightforward command-line interface for easy file management.
- **Versatile:** Supports various file formats and compression algorithms for flexibility.

### Compatibility

| Compression Method | Compression | Decompression |
| ------------------ | ----------- | ------------- |
| Stored             | ‚úì           | ‚úì             |
| Deflate            | ‚úì           | ‚úì             |
| Deflate64          |             | ‚úì             |
| Bzip2              | ‚úì           |               |
| LZMA               |             | ‚úì             |
| Zstd               | ‚úì           |               |

This means that Rzip supports the following extensions:
`.zip`, `.bz2`, `.tbz2`, `.lzma`, `.zst`.
